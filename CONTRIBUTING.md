# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Outbreak Science Rapid PREreview (OSrPRE)! As a project that values contributions to open science publishing, we also value contributions to the open-source code that powers this project.

## We develop on Github

The project is currently hosted on Github, and we use Github issues, projects, wikis, and pull requests to manage the process of software development.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/PREreview/rapid-prereview/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/PREreview/rapid-prereview/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code when possible

The more information you can provide for the context of the bug you're reporting, how it is reproduced, and what you were doing when you experienced it, the easier it is for a developer to track it down.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Find an issue to work on

You can find issues to work on by looking at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/PREreview/rapid-prereview/issues). Issues that are good places to start are tagged ["good first issues"](https://github.com/PREreview/rapid-prereview/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## How to create a development environment

The process for running an instance of OSrPRE locally is outlined in the [README](https://github.com/PREreview/rapid-prereview#development). Simply clone the repository and then follow the instructions in the *Development* section of the README to create a local environment using docker-compose.

## Code contributions are made using pull requests

In order to contribute code:

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes using a consistent coding style (documentation and unit tests are appreciated!)
3. Submit a pull request with a description of the change and a mention of the issue number (if any) it's addressing.
4. A maintainer will review your pull request as soon as they can, and either merge it or provide further feedback.

Thanks so much for contributing!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
